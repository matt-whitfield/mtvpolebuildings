  title="Zack Whitfield"
  description1="Zack's journey into the world of pole building construction began under the wing of his stepdad when he was just 15. What started as part-time summer work swiftly evolved into a lifelong passion. Eager to spread his wings, Zack ventured into city life at 18 but found himself drawn back to his roots, returning home to establish a lasting presence. Zack committed to working full-time alongside Donnie 10 years ago, absorbing invaluable experience and steadily assuming greater responsibilities within the business. Today, as the driving force behind our day-to-day operations, Zack seamlessly blends the values of fair pricing, dedicated work ethic, and an unwavering commitment to delivering unparalleled quality â€“ principles instilled by both him and Donnie."
